## Overview
I've always enjoyed the honeycomb mirror arrangement of [NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)](https://jwst.nasa.gov/content/webbLaunch/index.html | width = 10). To commemorate the telescope's launch on December 22, 2021, I created a set of DIY Nanoleaf LED wall panels inspired by the telescope's primary mirror.
